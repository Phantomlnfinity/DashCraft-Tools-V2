**NOTE:** The folder will be 2 layers deep because of how Github exports the files (something like `C:\Users\Username\Downloads\Dashcraft-Tools-V2-main\Dashcraft-Tools-V2-main`).

# Using the extension

## Miscellaneous

### Page Size

### Position in Thumbnail

## Track Editor

### Force Public

### Override Pieces

## Account Switcher

### Auto Add Accounts
With this enabled, any account you sign in to will automatically be added to the sign in tab.

### Sign In / Remove / Copy / Copy As Bookmark
Clicking this button toggles between the modes. When you hover over the button, a menu will appear on the right will all of your accounts. In Sign In mode, clicking an account will refresh the page and sign you in to that account. In Remove mode, clicking an account will remove it from the list. In copy mode, clicking an account will copy the token. And, in Copy As Bookmark mode, clicking an account will copy a bookmarklet that will sign you in to the account.

### Copy All / Paste
The copy button will copy the full list of account tokens to your clipboard. Sometimes your browser will just clear the extension's data, so you should store the tokens somewhere else. Never share these tokens with somebody else unless you want to give them access to your accounts. The paste button allows you to import one or multiple tokens from your clipboard.
